        <h2>1.Overview</h2>
        <p><i>Author: Mayuri Pandey</i></p>
        <p> 
            Data can be found abundantly over the Internet, and there are databases available, which help in the storage and retrieval of those data and information. Nowadays, there is a rapid growth of location-specific devices that need geographical features and spatial data, and there exist several challenges to maintain such data. Hence in 1997 the Open Geospatial Consortium developed few specifications and set few standards for adding various spatial functionality to the database systems <a href=#r1>[1]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, in this regard, Geospatial Database or Spatial Data has been well-defined as collective sets of stored information which is used to depict any data which is related to or consists of information about a particular location on the Earth’s Surface. The main goal of this report is to understand the concept of geospatial databases in brief and to have a thorough understanding of various tools available, how these tools will help us to optimize data <a href=#r2>[2]</a>.

        <h2>2.Geospatial Databases</h2>
        <p><i>Author: Mayuri Pandey</i></p>
        <p> 
            Geospatial database, defined as a group of different data sets stored in a common System file folder. The database can be generalized as containing geographic information of countries, cities, different administrative divisions, etc <a href=#r2>[2]</a>. It mainly has data about the locations, geographic features, and the relationship between them, which are stored as coordinates and topology. It is structured in a way as to ensure maximum productivity from the database<a href=#r2>[2]</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            It follows ESRI standard format and acts as collective storage for various data types like Raster, Vector, Tables, etc. Another important feature is also the scalability, i.e, single to multiple editing can be achieved <a href=#r2>[2]</a>. It acts as a physical store for the geographical information using a database stem where we can not only access but also work with the physical instances such as a collection of the data sets using SQL, it consists of a model that represents and manages the geographical information which supports the rules to manage spatial integrity and the tools to work with the attributes<a href=#r2>[2]</a>.

        <h2>3.Vector and Raster data in Geospatial database </h2>
        <p><i>Author: Khushbu Navdiwala</i></p>
        <p> 
           <b>Raster Data:</b> 
           Pixels that are assembled through rows or columns are made by the Raster Model. This data includes digital drone footage, space-station photos, or even digital information that will specifically be shown. There is 2 type of Raster Data:
        <ol>
           <li>
              Discrete raster is easy to separate as data 
              because they are made by themes, where one value may describe land cover, and the river can indicate another.
           </li>
           <li>
              Continuous rasters represent above/below sea level values. A good example of continuous raster data is digital elevation models(3d surface visualization)<a href=#r17>[17]</a>.
           </li>
        </ol>
        <p> 
           <b>Vector Data:</b> 
           Vector data are made of points, lines, and polygons, all of which are used in maps to reflect real-world characteristics.
           All geometry types store details in x/y coordinates <a href="#17">[17]</a>.</p>
        <ol>
           <li>
              Point data typically reflects small objects, such as tiny houses, pylons, important landmark features <a href="#17">[17]</a>.
           </li>
           <li>
              Line data reflect characteristics such as transport (roads, cart paths, trails), rivers, cables, pipes <a href="#17">[17]</a>.
           </li>
           <li>
              Polygon data reflects characteristics, such as land cover, area hydrography, large structures, boundaries of city/county/state/country<a href=#r17>[17]</a>.
           </li>
        </ol>

        <p><i>Author: Khushbu Navdiwala</i></p>
        <p> 
           A geodatabase is a "box"  that is used to contain a data array. There are three types of datatype<a href=#r3>[3]</a>:
        <p><b> In files system </b>information is stored in the storage device as folders. All information is provided as a document that might have a length of up to 1 TB. Compared to the personal geodatabase a  file database is strongly advised<a href=#r3>[3]</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Personal Geodatabases</b> All resources are stored in a 2 GB limited Microsoft Access data file<a href=#r3>[3]</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Enterprise databases</b> also referred to as multi-user, can have large consumer ranges and counts. Collected by either Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, IBM DB2, IBM Informix, or PostgreSQL in a database system<a href=#r3>[3]</a>.</p>

        <h2>7.Demonstration</h2>
        <p><i>Author: Mayuri Pandey</i></p>
        <p>Geographical information systems help us find a wide range of geographical information all over the Earth's surface, so keeping in mind the different functionalities of each tool, for our demonstration we have used GrassGIS, like other tools, this also had its share of pros and cons. However, why this tool has been used and what are the features that it provides has been explained in brief below:</p>
        <h3>GrassGIS:</h3>
        <p>GrassGIS is a typical tool used in finding Geographical Information systems. It is specially designed to analyze and manage the vector and raster data, model the spatial data, 3D visualization of the map, and geoprocessing<a href="#r15">[15]</a>. It is free and open-source software. We chose this tool for a deep understanding of the geospatial databases for many reasons, for instance, there are no limitations of operating systems, it supports Linux, Windows, and Mac and also it consists of an intuitive, user-friendly GUI and command line, the backend language used here is Python, while using the software, the user is not required to know about the language and can work by knowing few basic commands in the command line. GrassGIS supports all the SQL interface functionalities <a href="#r15">[15]</a><a href="#r16">[16]</a>.</p>
            
        <p>To understand this platform in brief, we need to understand few very important aspects of the tool, these are explained below:</p>
        <p><b>Terrain Analysis:</b> It assists in detailed analysis and interpretation of the various topological features through the Geographical Information System. The different Terrain Analysis includes a slope, aspect, viewshed, shaded surfaces, elevations, etc. It also shades the elevation layer we came <a href="#r16">[16]</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Hydrological Analysis:</b> It assists the user to have a thorough understanding, predicting various aspects, and managing the water resources <a href="#r16">[16]</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Why is Raster data used?</b></p>
            <p>The raster data can be easily rescaled and masked, hence masking is one of the most important criteria to consider while working with maps. Each location contains useful sensitive data, hence Masking is done when maps are read to protect the user data <a href="#r16">[16]</a>.</p>
        <p><b>Why is Vector data used?</b></p>
            <p>Vector data aids in maintaining the vector maps with clean geometry and maintaining the same, it also helps in analyzing the topological data, so it needs to be considered while working for a specific location <a href="#r16">[16]</a>.</p>
    
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>GrassGIS always works with data that is being imported using the database of the GrassGIS itself, so no matter what location we work with, all the data needs to be imported. For our demonstration, we have used the map set of Wake Country, Raleigh, US, and we will try to analyze this dataset.</p>
                
               <p><b>The plot Evaluation Profile:</b> After the selection of the raster and vector layers, if the user needs, he can simply select the coordinates according to his requirement and plot the evaluation map of that region. A Detailed view of the same is shown in figure 2 <a href="#r16">[16]</a> :

                  </figure>
                <p><b>Watershed and Streams:</b> This is done to show the various hydrological resources available in that particular region. We have considered only the basin and streams of the particular region which is shown in figure 3 <a href="#r16">[16]</a>:</p>

        <h2>8.Advantages and Disadvantages of Geospatial Databases</h2>
        <p><i>Author: Khushbu Navdiwala</i></p>
        <p> 
           <b>Advantages</b> <a href="#r19">[19]</a>:
        <p>Every GIS user's search is to construct a more precise representation of the real world. For many applications, this technology will take you closer to the objective. The basic concept behind this technology is to make it more intuitive to work with GIS data and applications. Any of the features that make it so useful to use this technology <a href="#r21">[21]</a>:</p>
        <ol>
           <li>
              <b>Centralized data management:</b> In the same geospatial database, you can store various spatial and tabular data formats. It has never been easier to handle and access data. Protection and access rights for multi-users can be handled down to the level of the individual feature class <a href="#r21">[21]</a>.
           </li>
           <li>
              <b>Continuous Sets of features:</b> Without tiles or other spatial partitions, it can handle large feature sets. Based on the necessary data, you can set the spatial domain for each geodatabase you can generate <a href="#r21">[21]</a>.
           </li>
           <li>
              <b>More detailed editing of data:</b> Validation rules will avoid several mistakes and recognize others. You can monitor interactions and relationships among features with validation rules and define appropriate values for attributes <a href="#r21">[21]</a>.
           </li>
           <li>
              <b> Versioning:</b> Versioning is enabled by multi-user geodatabases, which means that more than one person can modify the database simultaneously. Using a conflict resolution dialog, you can reconcile modifications to the same features or attributes by more than one user. When disputes are settled, the database's master version is modified. In addition to simplifying the process of editing, versioning can be used by organizations to handle alternative engineering <a href="#r21">[21]</a>.
           </li>
           <li>
              <b>Using Geospatial technology,</b> we can get some specific visual location information, it has the ability to make maps from given images, and also can be used for large projects which are connected with geography.
              It also supports efficiency, then easy to gather information by using different types of tools, giving high precision for any result, it estimates accurate presumptions and tests <a href="#r19">[19]</a><a href="#22">[22]</a>.
           </li>
           <li>A normal database system uses indexes; spatial databases use a spatial index to speed up the operations of the database <a href="#r19">[19]</a><a href="#22">[22]</a>.
           </li>
           
           <li> <b>From a financing point of view,</b> Geospatial is a one-off investment.  It can be utilized in the longer term for further observation as long as the information is gathered. It chooses to keep vibrant after two decades of advent. In recent years, the usage of this technology continues to increase at an impressive speed as more and more users cherish the value which is derived over the years, the performance of the method/task has been boosted by the adoption of this technology <a href="#r19">[19]</a><a href="#22">[22]</a>.
           </li>
        </ol>
        <b>Disadvantage</b> <a href="#r19">[19]</a><a href="#r22">[22]</a>:
        <ol>
           <li>
              Geospatial database is very costly software and for some tasks, it is important that it needs immense data input. Sometimes it's prone to wrong data that pass errors. It has an offense of privacy.
           </li>
           <li>This technology demand signals mostly from backwoods as it is largely depending on this so maybe geographical flaws arise as we used a large scale as our planet is a circle.</li>
           <li>Financial backing for the geospatial database is required because it is very expensive.</li>
           <li>The lack of understanding about the robustness of this technology is the greatest con of the geospatial industry. For individuals looking to leverage the technology to its fullest potential, this is the greatest hurdle. Not understanding the significant applications makes it much harder for individuals to use the technology. </li>
           <li>We can see a change in the development of knowledge as the level of awareness is raised. On the other hand, the shortage of human capital is considered by industry partners as the greatest impediment to offering or building an effective solution. The implementation of these technologies uses complex abilities, understanding, and awareness.</li>
           <li>Lack of knowledge about tools can lead to difficulty in implementation.

        <p><i>Author: Khushbu Navdiwala</i></p>
        <p> 
           <b>Geospatial in Retail:
           </b>
           Right now, data is an essential part of the world.  In order to obtain accumulation and digital evolution, big companies like Google, Amazon, and Walmart have esteemed the importance of geospatial data, and now others are following them. In particular, spatial data may support facts about the market, accommodation rates, financial production, residents, and length of existence for retailers.
           The brands and the goods they carry are calculated by these data.
           EX: Businesses such as Subway and McDonalds will evaluate desirable ideal sites in a common old-fashion sector, such as investment or junk food, and assessment of the past success of current locations.
           When selecting a location, socio-economic details such as road conditions, rush hours, and households in the area will be beneficial. Geospatial data could also provide knowledge on competitors in the field and anticipate potential developments or infrastructure projects that can influence the economy.
           For instance, assume a significant, long-planned route construction is planned that will affect rush hour concepts and business location connectivity
           <a href="#r18">[18]</a>.
        </p>
        <p> 
           <b>Geospatial in Healthcare: </b>
           Healthcare is an important sector in which we every year devote immense resources. Once a year flu seasons affect lots of humans around the globe and nowadays it is raised by COVID-19. Researchers and data technologists searching for the latest ways of fighting all health problems. Geospatial database gives vital components for dealing with this challenge of virus outbreaks. For both the study of a population of the same age, sex, race, and social status and the history of health care, geospatial data is essential.  Only then can we begin to take care of the effects on society and personal circumstances when we "recognize planet," in the process of creating a brand and key drivers then we remove it  get to know in which way a community is shaped by social expectations.
           Currently, multiple illnesses are being recognized using geographic methods. Rain place, environmental damage, or people's nomadic activities can all give hints and details to predict where there will be the highest need for healthcare in the long term. For example, this technology is used in Africa to reveal and map rubbish dumps as this is an effective breeding ground for insects carrying viruses.
           Using this technology for data and research refers to the health insurance industry's regular impact on quality. Geospatial application is capable of identifying, updating service providers about changes in consumer behavior, ecological consequences, risky area recognition, improvement, and the requirement for infrastructure that can be implemented should provide the best advantage
           <a href="#r18">[18]</a>.
        </p>
        <p> 
           <b>Geospatial in Finance: </b>
           Lots of financial services today use this technology for research and evidence in choice processes. Manufacturers can access new sets of details using geospatial data and having geospatial survey.
           conceptualizing commercial property or shareholdings associated with a specific project.
           Tracking changes with time to organizational, trade, or territorial blooming and production.
           The examination of resources and amenities could have a direct effect on expenditure in a locality.
           Using geospatial data to avoid incomplete or wrong customer transactions is one more benefit.
           All these Examples give us brief details about the benefit of this technology and help us to make a better final decision. And more importantly, we can diminish the investment damages that we could not
           do years ago
           <a href="#r18">[18]</a>.
        </p>
        <p> 
           <b>Geospatial in Logistics/Transportation:</b>
           Predominantly, with the permit of maps for direction and mobility, geospatial data has been most commonly related to transport. However, with plenty of digital maps that are changing the way to view our planet, we have seen several new applications are reachable.
           The financial system of today is oriented on how faster and cheaper outputs can be delivered while still maintaining high goods. In supply chains and routing through highways, railways, ports/sea, and airports geospatial data have been a primary factor. By decreasing the difficulty of traveling broad geographic areas, organizations are able to step up their game with this data. Such activities can be done in
           Use global positioning systems (GPS) for managing and tracing vehicles to speed up schedules.
