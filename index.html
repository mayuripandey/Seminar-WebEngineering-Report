        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p><i>Author:Mayuri Pandey</i></p>
        <p> 
            Data can be found abundantly over the Internet, and there are databases available, which help in the storage and retrieval of those data and information. Nowadays, there is a rapid growth of location-specific devices that need geographical features and spatial data, and there exist severe challenges to maintain such data. Hence in 1997 the Open Geospatial Consortium developed few specifications and set few standards for adding various spatial functionality to the database systems.<a href=#r1>[1]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, in this regard, Geospatial Database or Spatial Data has been well-defined as collective sets of stored information which is used to depict any data which is related to or consists of information about a particular location on the Earth’s Surface. The main goal of this report is to understand the concept of geospatial databases in brief and to have a thorough understanding of various tools available, how these tools will help us to optimize data.<a href=#r2>[2]</a>

            Geospatial database, defined as a group of different data sets stored in a common System file folder. The database can be generalized as containing geographic information of countries, cities, different administrative divisions,etc. It mainly has data about the locations, geographic features and the relationship between them, which are stored as coordinates and topology. It is structured in a way as to ensure maximum productivity from the database.<a href=#r2>[2]</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            It follows ESRI standard format and acts as collective storage for various data types like Raster, Vector, Tables, etc. Another important feature is also the scalability, i.e, single to multiple editing can be achieved. It acts as a physical store for the geographical information using a database stem where we can not only access but also work with the physical instances such as a collection of the data sets using SQL, it consists of a model that represents and manages the geographical information which supports the rules to manage spatial integrity and the tools to work with the attributes.<a href=#r2>[2]</a>

        <h2>6.Demonstration</h2>
        <p><i>Author:Mayuri Pandey</i></p>
        <p>Geographical information systems help us find a wide range of geographical information all over the earth surface, so keeping in mind the different functionalities of each tool, for our demonstration we have used GrassGIS, like other tools, this also had its own share of pros and cons. However, why this tool has been used and what are the features that it provides has been explained in brief below:</p>
        <h3>GrassGIS:</h3>
        <p>GrassGIS is a typical tool used in finding Geographical Information systems. It is specially designed in order to analyze and manage the vector and raster data, model the spatial data, 3D visualization of the map and geoprocessing. [15]It is free and open source software. We chose this tool for a deep understanding of the geospatial databases for many reasons, for instance, there are no limitations of operating systems, it supports Linux, Windows and Mac and also it consists of an intuitive, user-friendly GUI and command line, the backend language used here is Python, while using the software, the user need not need to know about the language and can work by knowing few basic commands in the command line. GrassGIS supports all the SQL interface functionalities.<a href="#r15">[15]</a><a href="#r16">[16]</a></p>
            
        <p>To understand this platform in brief, we need to understand few very important aspects of the tool, these are explained below:</p>
        <p><b>Terrain Analysis:</b> It assists in detailed analysis and interpretation of the various topological features through the Geographical Information System. The different Terrain Analysis includes a slope, aspect, viewshed, shaded surfaces, elevations etc. It also shades the elevation layer we came.<a href="#r16">[16]</a></p>
        <p><b>Hydrological Analysis:</b>It assists the user to have a thorough understanding, predicting various aspects and managing the water resources.<a href="#r16">[16]</a></p>
        <p><b>Why is Raster Data used?</b></p>
            <p>The raster data can be easily rescaled and masked, hence masking is one of the most important criteria to consider while working with maps. Each location contains useful sensitive data, hence Masking is done when maps are read to protect the user data.<a href="#r16">[16]</a></p>
        <p><b>Why is Vector Data used?</b></p>
            <p>Vector Data aids in maintaining the vector maps with clean geometry and maintaining the same, it also helps in analyzing the topological data, so it needs to be considered while working for a specific location.<a href="#r16">[16]</a></p>
    
            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <p>GrassGIS always works with data that is being imported using the database of the GrassGIS itself, so no matter what location we work with, all the data needs to be imported. For our demonstration, we have used the map set of Wake Country, Raleigh, US, and we will try to analyze this dataset.</p>
                
               <p><b> Plot Evaluation Profile:</b> After the selection of the raster and vector layers, if the user needs, he can simply select the coordinates according to his own requirement and plot the evaluation map of that region. Detailed view of the same is shown in the figure 3.<a href="#r16">[16]</a>
                <figure>
                    <img src="plotprofile.png" alt="Liste aller Benutzer"/>
                    <figcaption>
                      <strong>Fig 2</strong>: Plot Elevation profile <a href="#r13"></a>
                    </figcaption>
                  </figure>
                <p><b>Watershed and Streams:</b>This is done to show the various hydrological resources available in that particular region. We have considered only the basin and streams of the particular region which is shown in the figure:<a href="#r16">[16]</a></p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="waterstreams.PNG" alt="Liste aller Benutzer"/>
                    <figcaption>
                      <strong>Fig 3</strong>:Water and Stream Analysis <a href="#r13"></a>
                    </figcaption>
                  </figure>

                <p><b>SQL & Attribute table:</b>GrassGIS allows all the SQL operations in the map set, we can perform join, select, create delete etc. and all the other functions. However If the user requires only a few location information, it gives the flexibility to do that also, so as per the user needs selecting the desired query on the attribute table one can achieve a lot. This can be well understood in the figure:<a href="#r16">[16]</a></p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="sqlattribute.PNG" alt="Liste aller Benutzer"/>
                    <figcaption>
                      <strong>Fig 4</strong>:SQL attribute table <a href="#r13"></a>
                    </figcaption>
                  </figure>
                <p><b>3D Visualization:</b> GrassGIS is capable of rendering all 3D and 4D images. The detailed rendered view of the Wake Country, Rayleigh is shown below in the figure:<a href="#r16">[16]</a></p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="3Dvisualization.PNG" alt="Liste aller Benutzer"/>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p><i>Author:Mayuri Pandey, Khushbu Navdiwala</i></p>
        <p>After thorough research and understanding of the Geographical Information System, we can say that Geospatial Databases helps in achieving great efficiency and saves a lot of problem solving time. it helps users to have a better understanding and conceptualizing the different locations. Geospatial database assists in understanding and developing the most useful solution to any user-specific geographical data. Geospatial Database benefits not only the small but organizations of all sizes and industries of different scales. Various Innovation operations are looking for better ways to provide these frameworks with much more specific information. Furthermore, people have begun to realize that a correct decision about a specific location leads to the success of any strategic research and thus increasing their system results.</p>
